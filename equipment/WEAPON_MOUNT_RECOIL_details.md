# Weapon Compensators

`WEAPON_MOUNT_RECOIL` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

These specially designed compensators improve arm mounted weaponry, allowing far more accurate target grouping when it comes to faster reloading and movement recoil of projectile weaponry. This reduces spread marginally and increases its distance while also improving the chance not to jam from sudden movements.
