# Compact Internals

`CONDENSED_MYOMER` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

Tightly packed myomer bundles and complex cam actuators reduced in size to save on space for critical components and cellular ammo storage. This comes at a cost of over all mech speed and some internal structure. Usually found on medium mechs where they are not as slow as a larger chassis but their legs are not as vulnerable as a light chassis. C.A.S.E is often standard along with this with the extra space that is acquired.
