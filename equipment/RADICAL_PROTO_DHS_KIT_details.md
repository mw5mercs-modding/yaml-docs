# Radical PDHS Kit

`RADICAL_PROTO_DHS_KIT` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

The Radical Prototype Double Heatsink Kit converts the engine to use proto heat sinking. Allows the mech to equip Prototype Double Heatsinks.
Reduces the weapon heat generated by 20%.

Does not allow for additional heat sinks in the engine.

At high temperatures the Radical Heat Sink Kit's safeguards activate and provide additional heat dissipation until temperatures drop to safe levels. Prolonged activation risks failure, causing internal damage and additional heat buildup.
