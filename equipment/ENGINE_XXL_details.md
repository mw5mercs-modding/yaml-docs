# XXL Engine

`ENGINE_XXL` (Yet Another Mechlab)

XXL engines weigh 75% less than standard engines (not including Gyro, etc.). XXL engines require 6 free slots in each side torso, and generate heat (lower heat dissipation) even when the mech is not moving, and generate twice as much heat during movement as other engines. Losing a side torso will result in DEATH.
