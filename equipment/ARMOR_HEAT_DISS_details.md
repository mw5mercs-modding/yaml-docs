# Armor Heat Dissipating

`ARMOR_HEAT_DISS` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

Heat-Dissipating Armor is a derivative of the Fire-Resistant Armor used by Clan battlesuits. Created by the Capellan Confederation, it reduces the effects of fire and incendiary weapons on a BattleMech's heat exchange system while intact. Unlike some specialty armors, it is effective against most weapons, but the increased bulk of the armor (from additional insulation and modified sealants) results in less overall protection per ton.
