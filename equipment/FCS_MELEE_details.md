# FCS Melee

`FCS_MELEE` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

The Angst Clear View 1A was designed for the Solaris Market. Each Clear View 1A system had to be painfully calibrated to the Pilot's Neurohelm. Coupled with a movement prediction algorithm, it allowed the 'Mech to engage in lightning fast strikes without telegraphing the intent of the Pilot. Closing the Enemies' dodging window by around half.
