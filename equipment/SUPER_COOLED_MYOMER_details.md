# Super Cooled Myomer

`SUPER_COOLED_MYOMER` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

The RISC Super-Cooled Myomer is a Dark Age era improvement on myomer. It offers a benefit in that it effectively eliminates heat buildup due to movement.
The system works by adding friction-reducing fluids to the myomer, secondary coolant lines between myomer bundles, and sheathing the key myomer bundles in extra insulation.
This myomer is not compatible with any other type of myomer or myomer enhancements.
