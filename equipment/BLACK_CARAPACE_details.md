# Black Carapace

`BLACK_CARAPACE` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

The Black Carapace is the result of a secret research project which integrated the HarJel self-repair system directly into the armor plates. As a result the armor is slightly more bulky and heavier but the self-repair effect makes more than up for this.
However, due to the compact build weapon heat can be vented less effectively.
