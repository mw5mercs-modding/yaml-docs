# Exothermic Housing

`WEAPON_MOUNT_HEAT` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

The custom made housing while constricting it works like a cooling jacket however at a reduced rate it is essentially a thermal barrier between the weapon and the primary heat exchange. This allows for greater cooling of a single hardpoint location. The drawback is it reduces the mobility of the arms to a degree affecting its arc and angle. These are usually equipped on high heat generators such as Laser and Particle weaponry.
