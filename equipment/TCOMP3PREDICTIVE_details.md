# TC Projectile Predictive

`TCOMP3PREDICTIVE` (Yet Another Mechlab)

Advanced Targeting Computer that predicts projectile trajectory and drop of the actually selected ballistic weapon (Autocannons, PPCs, Gauss, etc) and selected enemy unit movement for pinpoint accuracy while in combat, by drawing a crosshair on the HUD at the optimal aim location. Based on Navid A1's code from Reloaded.
