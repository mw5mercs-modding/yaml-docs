# Laser Pulse Module

`LASER_PULSE_MODULE` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

Developed by the Republic Institute of Strategic Combat just shortly prior to the infamous Black Out, the Laser Pulse Module was originally designed to be fitted on any Standard or ER Laser, giving it an alternate fire mode which increases the heat output but increases the accuracy along the same lines as a Pulse Laser. Recent iterations, however, have evolved it into a general-purpose laser enhancement module.
