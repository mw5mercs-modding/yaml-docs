# Cooling Jacket

`COOLING_JACKET` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

Used as a Thermal barrier between shielded electronics and the primary heat exchange it is barely more than a secondary heat exchange fitted around the arm actuators. This allows for greater cooling of a single hardpoint location. The drawback is it reduces the mobility of the arms to a degree affecting its arc and angle. These are usually equipped on high heat generators such as Laser and Particle weaponry.
