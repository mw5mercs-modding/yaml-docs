# Firestorm Autoloader

`FIRESTROM_AUTOLOADER` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

The Firestorm Autoloader was a late development to help combat rapidly changing defensive equipment, while it is still effected by ECM it improves load times and hotloads the warheads before it fires. In most cases these are safe to operate at a distance. However should the autoloader sustain enough damage there is a high chance the pre-activated warheads will explode and damage other systems as well.
