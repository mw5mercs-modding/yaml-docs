# Armor: Ferro Lamellor (C)

`FERRO_LAMELLOR_CLAN` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

Created by the Scientist caste of Clan Snow Raven in 3070, Ferro-Lamellor armor is based on the Ferro-Carbide armor used in the Raven's WarShips. Scaled down for use on 'Mechs, AeroSpace Fighters, and tanks, the experimental Ferro-Lamellor armor offers improved protection, beyond even that of the Ferro-Fibrous armor family.

Though it only offers 88% coverage compared to standard armor , Ferro-Lamellor has a unique property: It reduces the damage of weapon strikes by 20%. In addition, the armor will reinforce the structure of the unit mounting it.
