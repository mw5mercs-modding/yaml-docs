# C3 Client Unit

`C3_CLIENT_UNIT` (Yet Another Mechlab)

The C3 client unit is the second part of a C3 network. Weighing a single ton and carried by the members of a lance or company, when it links to a C3 command unit it can share targeting information with all of the units linked into the network. Without a C3 command unit, the C3 client is useless.
