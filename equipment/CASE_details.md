# C.A.S.E.

`CASE` (Yet Another Mechlab)

C.A.S.E. is short for Cellular Ammunition Storage Equipment. In an internal explosion event, C.A.S.E. prevents the explosion from travelling to adjacent mech compartments. While C.A.S.E. does not prevent damage to occur in the protected area, it does prevent it from passing through, helping to prevent internal explosions to reach the center torso of a mech. Can't be installed on arms and legs.
