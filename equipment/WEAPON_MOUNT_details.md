# Weapon Stabilizers

`WEAPON_MOUNT` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

These specially designed gyro compensated stabilizers improve arm mounted weaponry, allowing far more accurate target grouping when it comes to faster resetting to target and movement drift. This enhances cooldown resets marginally while also improving impact damage. Unfortunately this also comes at a cost of effectively pulling punches as the stabilizers fight against drastic arm movements.
