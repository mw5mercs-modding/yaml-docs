# Structure Endo-Composite (C)

`ENDO_COMPOSITE_STRUCTURE_CLAN` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

Endo-Composite Structure is an experimental chassis technology developed by the Lyran Alliance in 3067. By mixing and matching standard and Endo-Steel components, engineers created a BattleMech skeleton that weighed 75% of a standard chassis but was only half as bulky as a traditional Endo-Steel system. Clan version of the Endo-Composite armor originally developed by the Lyrans. The big difference is that it requires two extra slots less.
