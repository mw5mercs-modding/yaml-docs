# Light Engine

`ENGINE_LIGHT` (Yet Another Mechlab)

Light fusion engines weigh 25% less than standard engines (not including Gyro, etc.). However, losing a side torso would cause penalties in speed and heat dissipation (removes half of the engne's heat capacity and dissipation and limits maximum speed to 75%). This engine requires 2 free slots in each side torso. Losing BOTH side torsos will result in DEATH.
