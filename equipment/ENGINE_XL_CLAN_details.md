# XL Engine (C)

`ENGINE_XL_CLAN` (Yet Another Mechlab)

Clan Extra Light fusion engines weigh 50% less than standard engines (not including Gyro, etc.). However, losing a side torso would cause penalties in speed and heat dissipation (removes half of the engne's heat capacity and dissipation and limits maximum speed to 75%). This engine requires 2 free slots in each side torso. Losing BOTH side torsos will result in DEATH.
