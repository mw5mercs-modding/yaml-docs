# Targeting Computer MK.7

`TCLVL7` (Yet Another Mechlab)

Not to be confused with the Targeting-tracking system, the Targeting Computer was introduced by Clan Mongoose in 2860. Targeting Computers are sophisticated pieces of electronics that, unlike normal targeting systems, physically help MechWarriors target their opponents. Recoil compensators and gyroscopic stabilizers are used to prevent normal weapon drift from factors such as recoil and movement, while the computer accounts for atmospheric and other conditions to present an accurate "lead" on the target. This allows for more surgical precision of weapons fire, especially with naturally accurate systems, allowing for the user to hit specific parts on the target vehicle. The Inner Sphere finally caught up to Clan technology with the Federated Suns' development of their own targeting computer in 3062.
