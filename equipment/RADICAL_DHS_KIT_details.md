# Radical DHS Kit

`RADICAL_DHS_KIT` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

Converts the engine to use double heat sinks. Allows the mech to equip double heat sinks.

At high temperatures the Radical Heat Sink Kit's safeguards activate and provide additional heat dissipation until temperatures drop to safe levels. Prolonged activation risks failure, causing internal damage and additional heat buildup.
