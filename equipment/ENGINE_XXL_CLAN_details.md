# XXL Engine (C)

`ENGINE_XXL_CLAN` (Yet Another Mechlab)

Clan XXL engines weigh one-third as much as standard fusion engines (not including Gyro, etc.). Clan XXL engines require 4 free slots in each side torso, and generate heat (lower heat dissipation) even when the mech is not moving, and generate twice as much heat during movement as other engines. Losing a side torso will result in DEATH.
