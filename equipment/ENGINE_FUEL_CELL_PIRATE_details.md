# Pirate Fuel Cell

`ENGINE_FUEL_CELL_PIRATE` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

This was a Light Engine until someone ripped out the Fusion compartment and wired a Fuel Cell into its assembly. They even managed to improve the energy converters wired into it. I can repair it, but this thing can never leave this 'Mech or be used otherwise. Cannot use Additional Cooling Kits, Exchanger or Banks.
