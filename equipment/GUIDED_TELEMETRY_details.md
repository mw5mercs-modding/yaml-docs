# S.R. Guided Telemetry

`GUIDED_TELEMETRY` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

S.R Guided Telemetry is a Short Range improvement system by nature. The telemetry unit aides short range missile systems cope with ECM and EW systems by a slight margin. Additionally most dumb fire short range missiles have a reduced spread with the additional calculations provided by the telemetry. However this will only effect the hardpoints in a single location to prevent overloading the system signal bus.
