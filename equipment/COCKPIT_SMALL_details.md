# Cockpit Small

`COCKPIT_SMALL` (Yet Another Mechlab)

First introduced by the Federated Suns in 3067, a Small Cockpit is a special cockpit for BattleMechs. By reducing the weight and support equipment the small cockpit only weighs two-thirds as much as a standard cockpit. It also frees up room in the 'Mech's head, so larger equipment can be mounted there. These advantages are offset by the reduced life support equipment and the generally cramped conditions that are forced on the MechWarrior.
