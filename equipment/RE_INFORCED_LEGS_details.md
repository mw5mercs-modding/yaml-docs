# Reinforced Legs

`RE_INFORCED_LEGS` (Yet Another Equipment Collection)

Precursor to the resurgence of Endo-Steel in 3035, Reinforced Legs use endo-steel alloys mixed with ceramics and its ferro-titanium structure. While this technically does not save weight it does bolster its ability to take incoming damage. With the use of ceramics often it included C.A.S.E as a standard add-on.
