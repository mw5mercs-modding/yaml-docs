# C3i Unit

`C3I_UNIT` (Yet Another Mechlab)

Based on the C3 system, the improved C3 computer (or C3i) combines the functions of a C3 command unit and C3 client units into a single system. Unlike a standard C3 lance, where interruption or destruction of the C3 master computer brings down the network, each C3i unit acts as an equal "cellular" partner in the network, making C3i networks more robust. A C3i is able to survive and function despite unit losses or the effects of electronic countermeasures.
